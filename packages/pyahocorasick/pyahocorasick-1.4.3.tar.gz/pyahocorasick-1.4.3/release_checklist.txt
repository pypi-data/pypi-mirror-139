Use this checklist to track the thing to check before a release.

1. Push a branch with all the code ready for release. Check that the
   the automated teats and build did run OK on all the OS/Python combos
   supported by the various CI (Appveyor, Travis and Github Actions).

2. Run these extra tests on Linux.
   You will need valgring and gcovr installed first.

./runtest.sh pycallfaults      [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh coverage          [ ]        [ ]


Once you ran the coverage, copy and commit the coverage/ report to 
etc/coverage
