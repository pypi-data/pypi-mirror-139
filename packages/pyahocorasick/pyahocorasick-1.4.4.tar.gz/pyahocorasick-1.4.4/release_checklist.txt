Use this checklist to track the thing to check before a release.

1. Push a branch with all the code ready for release. Check that the
   the automated teats and build did run OK on all the OS/Python combos
   supported by the various CI (Appveyor, Travis and Github Actions).

2. Run these extra tests on Linux.
   You will need valgring and gcovr installed first.


action                       python2    python3
--------------------------------------------------
make test                      [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh unit              [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh unpickle          [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh valgrind          [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh mallocfaults      [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh reallocfaults     [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh pycallfaults      [ ]        [ ]
./runtest.sh coverage          [ ]        [ ]


Once you ran the coverage, copy and commit the coverage/ report to 
etc/coverage


3. marge and tag the release w=once everything is a-OK

4. Finally: 

- collect the built wheels and sdist from the CI run for the tag run (artifact.zip)
- extract the zip
- run a clamscan and a twine check on these
- publish on PyPI with twine.
