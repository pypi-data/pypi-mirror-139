# Topsis

Topsis-Prabal-101916102 is a library for calculating topsis score and ranking them according to the score.


## What is Topsis

Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution. More details at wikipedia.
