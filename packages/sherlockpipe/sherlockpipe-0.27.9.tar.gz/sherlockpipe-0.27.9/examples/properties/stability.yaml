# Example properties file for calculating a stability scenario with two planets:
# 0: The star with a lowest mass value of 1.0R_sun and an highest mass value of 1.3R_sun, sampled in 2 bins.
# 1: A planet with a period of 15 days and a lowest and highest mass with the same value of 1.5R_earth. The
# eccentricity will be sampled in 2 bins from 0 to 0.1
# 1: A planet with a period of 15 days and a lowest mass of 2R_earth and highest mass of 2.4R_earth. The
# eccentricity lowest value is 0 and the highest is 0.1.
