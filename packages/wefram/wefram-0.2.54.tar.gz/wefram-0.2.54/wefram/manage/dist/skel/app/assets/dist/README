All files from this directory, including the existing directory
structure, will be copied in the static build directory within
parent directory 'dist' and app's name directory.

For example, we have the app named 'demotest' with the next
dist structure:

/demotest
  /assets
    /dist
      /mydir1
        somefile1.js
        somefile2.js
      /mydir2
        someimg.png
        someimg2.jpg
      somestyle.css

Then, the resulting URL structure will be:

/static/dist/demotest/mydir1/somefile1.js
/static/dist/demotest/mydir1/somefile2.js
/static/dist/demotest/mydir2/someimg.png
/static/dist/demotest/mydir2/someimg2.jpg
/static/dist/demotest/somestyle.css
