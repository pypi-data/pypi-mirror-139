API
===


The platform consists of both backend and frontend. Each of those two
parts doing own work - backend is a server-side, data-storing and
computing set of processes. Frontend is an any application, including
web browser tab with loaded Wefram-based web code, or mobile apps for
Android, Apple iOS and etc.

The frontend itself costs nothing without working backend and a some
posibility to interact with it. The API *is* the way the frontend and
backend, in general, interacting with each other.
