Files in this directory will be embedded in the final
project build. Instead of other files, localed in the
parent (higher-level) directory, these ones will not
be minified or simplified or any other kind of
automation.

In addition, embedded resources are located higher in
the resulting assets resource, than non-embedded ones,
so the client browser will read and execute them prior
than higher-level.

So, the final merged resource file (assets.<uuid>.type)
will look like:

<embedded_styles>
<embedded_styles>
...
<project_styles>
<project_styles>
...
