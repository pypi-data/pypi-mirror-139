Place localization directories in this folder.
Localizations are made as JSON files, containing
international phrases (english) and corresponding
localized ones.

The corresponding filenames are same as locale
names with .json extensions. For example, for
Russian localization filename will be:

ru_RU.json

You may create localized texts by creating directory
with the corresponding locale named name (the same
as corresponding JSON file) and place texts into
this directory.

For example, the resulting files structure for the
Russian locale will look like:

/<app_name>
  /assets
    /l10n
      /ru_RU
        my_text.md
        my_other_text.md
      ru_RU.json
