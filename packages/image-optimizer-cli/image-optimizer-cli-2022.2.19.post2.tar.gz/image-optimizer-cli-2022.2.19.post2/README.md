* Optimize all images in a folder: ``image-optimizer -p /path/to/images/``

* Optimize all images in a folder recursively: ``image-optimizer -p /path/to/images/ -r``

* Optimize a number of images: ``image-optimizer -p /path/to/images/ -n 10``

* Optimize with custom quality: ``image-optimizer -p /path/to/images/ -q 30``
