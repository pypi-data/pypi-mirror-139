class RankSelection:
    '''Rank solution candidates according to fitness and select the top candidates.
    Rank Selection also works with negative fitness values and is mostly used when the individuals
    in the population have very close fitness values (this happens usually at the end of the run).
    This leads to each individual having an almost equal share of the
    pie (like in case of fitness proportionate selection) and hence each individual no matter
    how fit relative to each other has an approximately same probability of getting selected as a parent.
    This in turn leads to a loss in the selection pressure towards fitter individuals,
    causing the GA to make poor parent selections in such situations.

class TournamentSelection:

    tournament among them. Only the fittest candidate amongst those
    selected candidates is chosen and is passed on to the next generation.
    In this way many such tournaments take place and we have our final selection
    of candidates who move on to the next generation. It also has a parameter
    called the selection pressure which is a probabilistic measure of a candidateâ€™s
    likelihood of participation in a tournament. If the tournament size is larger,
    weak candidates have a smaller chance of getting selected as it has to compete
    with a stronger candidate. The selection pressure parameter determines the rate
    of convergence of the GA. More the selection pressure more will be the Convergence rate.
    GAs are able to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions over a wide range of selection pressures.
    Tournament Selection also works for negative fitness values.
