# Matrix Registration Bot

This bot aims to create and manage registration tokens for a matrix server. It wants to help invitation based servers to maintain usability.
It does not create a user itself, but rather aims to make use of the Matrix standard [MSC3231](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/main/proposals/3231-token-authenticated-registration.md).

This means, that a user that registers on your server has to provide a registration token to successfully create an
account. The token can be created by interacting with this bot. So to invite a friend you would send `create` to the bot
which answers with an token. You send the token to the friend and they can uses this to create an account.

The feature was added in Matrix v1.2. More information can be found in the [Synapse Documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/registration_tokens.html).

If you have any questions, or if you need help setting it up, come join [#matrix-registration-bot:hyteck.de](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-registration-bot:hyteck.de)

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

**Server configuration**

Your server should be configured to a token restricted registration. Add the following to your `homeserver.yaml`:

```yaml
enable_registration: true
registration_requires_token: true
```

**Create a bot account**

Then you need to create an account for the bot on the server, like you would do with any other account.
A good username is `registration-bot`. Also note the access token of the bot. One way to get the token is to login as 
the bot and got to Settings -> Help & About -> Access Token in Element.

Once you are finished you can start the installation of the bot.

## Installation

The installation can easily be done via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/matrix-registration-bot/)
```bash
$ pip install matrix-registration-bot
```

## Configuration

Configure the bot with a file named `config.yml`. It should look like this

```yaml
bot:
  server: "https://synapse.example.com"
  username: "registration-bot"
  access_token: "verysecret"
  # It is also possible to use a password based login by commenting out the access token line and adjusting the line below
  # password: "secretpassword" 
api:
  # API endpoint of the registration tokens
  base_url: 'https://synapse.example.com'
  endpoint: '/_synapse/admin/v1/registration_tokens'
  # Access token of an administrator on the server
  token: "supersecret"


```

# Usage

Start the bot with 
```bash
python -m matrix_registration_bot.bot
```

and then open a Direct Message to the bot. The type one of the following commands.

# Systemd

To have the bot start automatically after reboots create the file `/etc/systemd/system/matrix-registration-bot.service`
with the following content on your server. This assumes you use docker and that you place your configuration in
`/matrix/matrix-registration-bot/config.yml`.
```
[Unit]
Description=matrix-registration-bot
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Type=simple

WorkingDirectory=/matrix/matrix-registration-bot
ExecStart=python3 -m matrix_registration_bot.bot

Restart=always
RestartSec=30
SyslogIdentifier=matrix-registration-bot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After creating the service reload your daemon and start+enable the service.
```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl start matrix-registration-bot
$ sudo systemclt enable matrix-registration-bot
```

# Supported commands

**Unrestricted commands**
* `help`: Shows this help

**Restricted commands**
* `list`: Lists all registration tokens
* `show <token>`: Shows token details in human-readable format
* `create`: Creates a token that that is valid for one registration for seven days
* `delete <token>` Deletes the specified token(s)
* `delete-all` Deletes all tokens
* `allow @user:example.com` Allows the specified user (or a user matching a regex pattern) to use restricted commands
* `disallow @user:example.com` Stops a specified user (or a user matching a regex pattern) from using restricted commands

# Permissions

By default, any user on the homeserver of the bot is allowed to use restricted commands. You can change that,
by using the `allow` command to configure one (or multiple) specific user. Read the [simple-matrix-bot documentation](https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#allowlist)
for more information. If you get locked out for any reason, simply modify the config.toml that is created in the bots
working directory.
