Description: # Grandma Stock Valuation (GSV)
        *A simple, manageable valuation tool and portfolio builder for retail investors - even grandma can use it!*
        <br>
        * Valuate instrument with historical trends - no sophiscated technical analysis
        * Build a flexible portfolio with your personal interest
        * Trade at your own pace - you can even trade only once per month/quarter
        * Back your investment decision with firm numbers - no more frustration from all the media noise!
        
        <br>
        
        ## Introduction
        "Grandma-style" traders look at only the historical daily prices - buy when the price is low - sell when the price is high.
        
        <br>
        
        The **Grandma Stock Valuation** model enhanced this simple idea with a number of qualitative considerations:
        * Type of curves to fit on historical daily prices
        * Outliers identification
        * Evaluate *fair price*, *over-valued %*, and *over-valued years*
        
        In addition, the project includes a **portfolio allocator**, which suggests the portfolio allocation of your selected group of instruments.<br>
        It allocates larger proportion to more under-valued instruments, with several configurations:
        * Sensitivity to over/under valuation
        * Compensation to the number of instruments
        * Option to include cash as part of the portfolio, in order to realize profit
        
        <br>
        
        **Important Notes**
        * The valuation model is most suitable for **broad ETF**, such as S&P 500 ETF.
        * The portfolio allocator only works with **instruments with sufficient positive return** (suggest > 1% historical annualized return).
