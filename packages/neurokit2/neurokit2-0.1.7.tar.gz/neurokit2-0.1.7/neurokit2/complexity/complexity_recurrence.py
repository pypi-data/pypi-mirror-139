def complexity_recurrence(signal, delay=1, dimension=3, tolerance="default", show=False):
    """Recurrence matrix (Python implementation)

    Fast Python implementation of recurrence matrix (tested against pyRQA). Returns a tuple
    with the recurrence matrix (made of 0s and 1s) and the distance matrix (the non-binarized
    version of the former).

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.ndarray, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.
    delay : int
        Time delay (often denoted 'Tau', sometimes referred to as 'lag'). In practice, it is common
        to have a fixed time lag (corresponding for instance to the sampling rate; Gautama, 2003),
        or to find a suitable value using some algorithmic heuristics (see ``delay_optimal()``).
    dimension : int
        Embedding dimension (often denoted 'm' or 'd', sometimes referred to as 'order'). Typically
        2 or 3. It corresponds to the number of compared runs of lagged data. If 2, the embedding
        returns an array with two columns corresponding to the original signal and its delayed (by
        Tau) version.
    tolerance : float
        Tolerance (similarity threshold, often denoted as 'r'). The radius used for detecting
        neighbours (states considered as recurrent). A rule of thumb is to set 'r' so that the
        percentage of points classified as recurrences is about 2-5%.
    show : bool
        Visualise recurrence matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The recurrence matrix.
    np.ndarray
        The distance matrix.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=5, sampling_rate=100, frequency=[5, 6], noise=0.01)
    >>>
    >>> # Default r
    >>> rc, _ = nk.complexity_recurrence(signal, show=True)
    >>>
    >>> # Larger radius
    >>> rc, d = nk.complexity_recurrence(signal, tolerance=0.5, show=True)
    >>>
    >>> # Optimization of tolerance via recurrence matrix
    >>> rc, d = nk.complexity_tolerance(signal, delay=1, dimension=3, method="recurrence", show=True)
