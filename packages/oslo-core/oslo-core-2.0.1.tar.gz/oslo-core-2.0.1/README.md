## What is OSLO about?
OSLO is a framework that provides various GPU based optimization technologies for large-scale modeling. 
3D Parallelism and Kernel Fusion which could be useful when training a large model like [EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) are the key features. OSLO makes these technologies easy-to-use by magical compatibility with [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) that is being considered as a <i>de facto</i> standard in 2021.

## Installation
OSLO can be easily installed using the pip package manager.
All the dependencies such as [torch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/) and [transformers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) should be installed automatically with the following command.
Be careful that the 'core' is in the PyPI project name.

```console
pip install oslo-core
```

## Basic Usage
It only takes a single line of code. Now feel free to train and infer a large transformer model. ðŸ˜Ž

```python
import oslo

model = oslo.initialize(model, "oslo-config.json")
```
