What is OSLO about?
===================

OSLO is a framework that provides various GPU based optimization
technologies for large-scale modeling. 3D Parallelism and Kernel Fusion
which could be useful when training a large model like
`EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B <https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B>`__ are
the key features. OSLO makes these technologies easy-to-use by magical
compatibility with `Hugging Face
Transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`__ that is
being considered as a de facto standard in 2021.

Installation
============

OSLO can be easily installed using the pip package manager. All the
dependencies such as `torch <https://pypi.org/project/torch/>`__ and
`transformers <https://pypi.org/project/transformers/>`__ should be installed
automatically with the following command. Be careful that the â€˜coreâ€™ is
in the PyPI project name.

.. code:: console

   pip install oslo-core


Basic Usage
====================

It only takes a single line of code. Now feel free to train and infer a large transformer model. ðŸ˜Ž

.. code::

  import oslo

  model = oslo.initialize(model, "oslo-config.json")
