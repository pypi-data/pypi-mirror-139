# This was my first attempt at making something nice for myself and perhaps for others,
# I got tired of only using programming for boring old programming assignments so here we are. 
# I have a long way to go and I guess this is just the starting, I just hope that one day,
# when I look back this code, I'm actually proud of myself instead of being embarrassed.
