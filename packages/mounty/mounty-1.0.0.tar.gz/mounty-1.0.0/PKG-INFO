# mounty

A wrapper for Mountebank REST API, can be used for existing instances or for testing in CI/CD ephemeral Mountebank instances.

Who/what is Mountebank? Mountebank is an amazing open-source stub/service virtualisation tool, see more [here](http://www.mbtest.org/).
It can be used as a stub service for any external dependency, it can run as proxy (recording and replaying requests), it can be used for load testing services in isolation (stub external requests, so no more latency added)


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install mounty
```

## Usage examples:

```python
import requests
from mounty import Mountebank
from mounty.models import Imposter, Stub

SIMPLE_IMPOSTER = {
 "port": 4555,
 "protocol": "https",
 "stubs": [{"responses": [{"is": {"statusCode": 201}}]}],
}

# the url must contain the port on which Mountebank is listening
mountebank = Mountebank(url="http://mountebank.foo:2525")
# or, if MOUNTEBANK_URL variable is defined:
mountebank_from_env = Mountebank.from_env()

imposter = mountebank.add_imposter(imposter=SIMPLE_IMPOSTER)

other_imposter = mountebank.add_imposter(
 imposter=Imposter(
  port=4556,
  protocol="http",
  stubs=[Stub(responses=[{"is": {"statusCode": 201}}])],
 )
)

# peform 2 requests
requests.post(url="http://mountebank.foo:4545")
requests.post(url="http://mountebank.foo:4545")
# wait for maximum 2 seconds for the imposter to contain 2 recorded requests
reqs = mountebank.wait_for_requests(port=4555, count=2, timeout=2)
```

#### Local development

You will first need to clone the repository using git and place yourself in its directory:

```bash
$ poetry install -vv
$ poetry run pytest tests/
```

To make sure that you don't accidentally commit code that does not follow the coding style:

```bash
$ poetry run pre-commit autoupdate
$ poetry run pre-commit install
$ poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### TODOs

- Add integration tests which will create scenarios in several versions of Mountebank running as docker containers
- MORE examples
