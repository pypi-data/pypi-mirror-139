        <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
        ## About The Project
        
        This project is a wrapper for Pytorch neural networks (NNs) to obfuscate functionalities that are always used during training and testing of NNs. Such as loggers, training loops, and saving of NNs.

        ### Built With
        
        These are the libraries and frameworks with which the library is constructed:
        
        * [Python](https://python.org/)
        * [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

        <!-- GETTING STARTED -->
        ## Getting Started Locally
        
        This section explains how to set-up the repository locally from this repository. Note that this explanation is compatible for a MacOS / Linux environment.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        1. Have at least Python 3.8 installed on your local machine.
        2. Make sure to have [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed. Else, you can copy paste commands from the Makefile into your terminal.
        
        ### Installation
        
        1. Clone the repo and cd into it
           ```sh
           git clone https://gitlab.com/markdeblaauw/nn-helper.git
           ```
        3. Create a Python virtual environment
            ```sh
            make virtual_env
            . venv/bin/activate
            ```
        4. Install the development Python package
            ```sh
            make install_dev_package
            ```

        <!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
        ## Usage
        You can find the following example of using the library in the `examples` folder:
        
        ```python
        import math
        
        import models.linear_regression as linear_model
        import torch
        
        import nn_helper
        from nn_helper.callbacks.verbose_logger import VerboseLogger
        
        
        def run_model():
            # Create Tensors to hold input and outputs.
            x = torch.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, 2000)
            y = torch.sin(x)
        
            p = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
            xx = x.unsqueeze(-1).pow(p)
        
            # Only 1 sample. Hence, batch size of 1.
            data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset=linear_model.Dataset(x=xx, y=y), batch_size=1)
        
            loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()
        
            model = linear_model.LinearRegression()
        
            optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(params=model.parameters(), lr=1e-2)
        
            # Train the model with 10 epochs and use
            # Verbose Logger to put metrics to terminal.
            nn_helper.fit(
                model=model,
                data_loader=data_loader,
                epochs=10,
                loss_fn=loss_fn,
                optimizer=optimizer,
                callbacks=[VerboseLogger()],
            )
        ```
        
        ### Testing
        
        You can run unit tests locally as follows:
        ```bash
        make tests
        ```
        
        A coverage report can be generated with the intention of 100% coverage:
        ```bash
        make coverage_report
        ```

        ## Roadmap
        
        The library is not complete yet. Certain features, such as metric computation, testing and many callbacks, are not implemented yet. These will be implemented in due time.
