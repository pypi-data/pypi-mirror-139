    "`bw2qsd` is (currently) a lite package leveraging the [``Brightway2`` platform](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/index.html) for convenient importing of life cycle impact characterization factors (CFs) and use them in packages developed for quantitative sustainable design (QSD) of technologies and systems hosted on [the GitHub homepage of QSD-Group](https://github.com/QSD-Group). You can certainly use this package to just extract the CF values and use in other ways you like.\n",
