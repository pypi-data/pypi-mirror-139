osmscigrid
=============

**osmscigrid** is a Python library to create a `SciGRID_gas dataset  <https://www.gas.scigrid.de/downloads.html>`_ of the European gas transport 
pipelines from OpenStreetMap (OSM). It is based on the **esy-osmfilter** library, which is another outcome of the
the SciGRID_gas project and further described in this linked `article  <https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/article/10.5334/jors.317>`_ .


Features
--------

What does it provide:

- A routine to create SciGRID_gas data from OSM pbf-files
- A routine to extract meta data from OSM tags 
- A segmentation routine for pipelines which will remove some intermediate nodes and create short `PipeSegments`
- An option to remove short pipelines
- A routine to export the resulting dataset in the CSV or GeoJSON format
- A routine to read SciGRID_gas CSV files
- Creating country data from only one European OSM pbf-file 

What does it not provide:

- Extraction of gas network components other than pipelines
- Visualization of the data
- OSM pbf-files

Installation
------------

**osmscigrid** depends on a Python version of 3.6 or above as well as the
following libraries:


-   "matplotlib==3.3.3"
-   "mplcursors>=0.3"
-   "Unidecode==1.1.1"
-   'pandas>=0.25.3'
-   "esy-osm-pbf>=0"
-   "esy-osmfilter"
-   "quantulum3==0.7.6"
-   "PyShp"
-   "geopy"
-   "scipy"
-   "numpy==1.19.4"
-   "pathlib>=1.0.1"
-   "descartes==1.1.0"
-   "adjustText==0.7.3"
-   "Shapely==1.7.1"

Use ``pip`` to install **osmscigrid**:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install osmscigrid



Installation qplot
------------------

We recommend, that you also install **qplot** to visualize the results.
You can use ``pip`` to install **qplot**:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install qplot


Once you have installed **qplot**, you can import the quickplot function via:

.. code:: bash

    $ from qplot.qplot import quickplot


Download of WorldBorders
------------------------

In the next step you need to navigate to the webpage of `thematicmapping <https://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php>`_
and download the TM_WORLD_BORDERS zip-file, which is required for the country classification
but also to visualize the country borders with **qplot**.

Bugfixes:
---------

On some Windows machines, there might be some issues with the installation of "Shapely".
You can try to download the proper file from the `<https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely>`_
and install it via pip.

If this does not work, than you can add this two hidden options to your OSM.read *function* which will
deactivate the country classification.

* CreateCountryCodeForLines=False
* LoadCountryCodeForLines=False
