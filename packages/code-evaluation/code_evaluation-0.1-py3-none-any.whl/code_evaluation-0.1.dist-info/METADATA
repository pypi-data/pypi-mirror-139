Evaluation
==========

The goal is to provide a safer way to eval/exec code and provide some
utilities.

DISCLAIMER: This is still not sandboxed nor fool-proof and will never
be. The user should not trust unverified inputs and is the only one
responsible for the extra variables he provides. Even though the modules
allow to change the globals variables used for eval/exac, I am not
responsible for any addons to the globals either.

Usage
-----

Basique eval_code/exec_code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Work in the same way as eval/exec, but with limited set of action
possibles. Especially:

-  IO is removed (no open/file/print/… available)
-  No complex declaration (classes, functions, …)
-  we are limited to a single statement
