# Randalyze - Random Number Generator And Analyzer

## What Does Randalyze Do?

Randalyze is a Python module that you can import or use directly from the command line to generate a set of random numbers. These numbers will fit a specified distribution, rather than just being evenly distributed.

It also allows you to analyze a set of numbers, to see which distribution they match.

## Installation

Randalyze supports Python 3.8 and later, so you can install it on Windows 7 if you want. It doesn't support Python 2.7.

To install Randalyze, create a virtual environment and use `pip`:

```bash
pip install randalyze
```

## Usage

### Command Line Usage

#### Generating Random Numbers

The `generate` command creates a number of random numbers. The type of generator must be specified - currently the only option is `benford`, and the number (or count) of numbers generated is specified with the `-c` option.

For example, to generate 100 random numbers with a Benford distribution, the following command line can be used:

```bash
randalyze generate -c 100 benford
```

or, if you're not using an active virtual environment:

```bash
python -m randalyze generate -c 100 benford
```

For detailled parameter descriptions, use:

```bash
randalyze --help
randalyze generate --help
```

#### Analyzing Numbers

If you have a set of numbers, `randalyze` can analyze them and tell you how close to a Benford distribution they are. These numbers may have been generated by `randalyze`, or maybe obtained from somewhere else - it really doesn't matter.

Currently the `randalyze analyze` command accepts numbers piped from another command, and compares their distribution to the Benford distribution.

So, to analyze an output of 10,000 numbers from the `randalyze generate` command, and see whether it matches a Benford distribution to within 10%, use:

```bash
randalyze generate benford -c 10000 | randalyze analyze -t 10
```

And to ensure the numbers in a text file `numbers.txt`, with one number per line, fit a Benford distribution:

```bash
cat numbers.txt | randalyze analyze -t 10
```
