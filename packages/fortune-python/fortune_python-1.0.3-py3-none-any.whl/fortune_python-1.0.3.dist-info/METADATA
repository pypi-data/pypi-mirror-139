# Notes

The fortune data for this package is taken
from [fortune-mod](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod). Please see the
datfiles directory in this repo for their corresponding license.

The offensive fortunes in the 'off' directory are not included in this Python
package. However, the fortunes provided in this package are otherwise provided
as they were in the
original [fortune-mod](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod) repository.
I do not take responsibility for the content of these fortunes.
