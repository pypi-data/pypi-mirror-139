# netio-pdu-control
Library for control and monitoring of Netio PowerPDU devices over LAN.

This library has been implemented by IFAE (www.ifae.es) control software department.

## CLI tool
You may run the terminal client with `python -m netio_pdu_control`. By default it assumes that `credentials.cfg` is in the same folder, but a different path can be specified with the argument `--credentials / -c`.
