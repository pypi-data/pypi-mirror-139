<h4 id="templates">Templates</h4>
<p>
  Templates enable the creation of blueprints for resources. There are different types of templates, which define the
  actual content that a template can contain. The following types of templates currently exist:
</p>
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Record</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    <em>Record</em> templates can contain all of the metadata that can be specified for a record, including its generic
    extra metadata, and can be selected when creating a new record.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Extras</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    <em>Extras</em> templates are focused on the generic extra metadata of a record. Extras templates can be selected
    and combined wherever such metadata can be specified, including when creating other templates.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h5 id="new-template">Creating a new template</h5>
<p>
  Creating a new template is very similar to creating other kinds of resources. Each template requires at least setting
  a title and identifier for the template itself, while the actual template data depends on the type of template.
</p>
<h5 id="manage-template">Managing existing templates</h5>
<p>
  Similar to other resources, templates have their own navigation menu, offering the ability to edit existing templates
  or to share them with other users or groups. As with the other resources, the menu for the former also allows
  deleting templates. Note that compared to other resources, templates will currently be deleted directly and are not
  moved to the trash first.
