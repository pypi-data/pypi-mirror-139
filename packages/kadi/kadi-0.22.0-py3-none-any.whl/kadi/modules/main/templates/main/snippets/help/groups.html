<h4 id="groups">Groups</h4>
<p>Groups can be used to group several users together, allowing for easier access management.</p>
<h5 id="new-group">Creating a new group</h5>
<p>
  Creating a new group is again very similar to creating other resources. Aside from basic metadata, a group picture can
  also be uploaded, which will be shown on the group overview as well as on search result pages.
</p>
<h5 id="manage-group">Managing existing groups</h5>
<p>
  The management of existing groups is similar to other resources as well. The main difference is that instead of having
  a view for managing access permissions, there is a similar view for managing the members of a group.
</p>
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Manage members</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    <p>
      Managing the members of a group is comparable to managing the access permissions of records or collections, as
      group membership is linked to the access permissions of a group. Specifically, as long as a user has any role in a
      group, they are a member of this group as well, while of course also having the respective permissions their role
      provides within the group.
    </p>
    Additionally, it is possible to automate the assignment of roles within a group by specifying rules with different
    conditions in the corresponding tab. Each rule is applied when a new user registers, but it can also be applied
    retroactively to all existing users.
