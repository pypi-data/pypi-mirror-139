<h4 id="records">Records</h4>
<p>
  Records are the basic components of Kadi4Mat, as they contain data and connect it with metadata. The data of a record
  can either consist of a single file or multiple files (e.g. a series of multiple images) all sharing the same
  metadata. Records can also be grouped into collections or linked to other records, as described later.
</p>
<h5 id="new-record">Creating a new record</h5>
<p>
  Creating a new record first requires entering its metadata. This includes basic information, such as title, (unique)
  identifier and description. Additional, arbitrary, extra metadata can also be specified, specific for each different
  kind of record. This generic metadata consists of key-value pairs, where each entry has at least a unique key, a type
  and a corresponding value with optional validation instructions. It is also possible to create templates for the
  generic metadata, as described in <a href="#templates"><strong>Templates</strong></a>. The following values types can
  be used for this metadata:
</p>
<dl class="row mb-0">
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>String</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">A single text value.</dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>Integer</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">A single integer value. Integer values can optionally have a unit further describing them.</dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>Float</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    A single floating point value. Float values can optionally have a unit further describing them.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>Boolean</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">A single boolean value which can either be true or false.</dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>Date</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">A date and time value which can be selected from a date picker.</dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>Dictionary</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">A nested value which can be used to combine multiple metadata entries under a single key.</dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2"><strong>List</strong></dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    A nested value which is similar to dictionaries with the difference that none of the values in a list have a key.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Aside from the metadata, it is possible to set the visibility of a record to either <em>private</em> or
  <em>public</em>, the latter giving every logged-in user the ability to search for the record and view its contents
  without requiring explicit read permissions to do so. Finally, a record can be linked to one or more collections while
  creating it, which of course may also be done later on instead.
</p>
<p>
  Once the metadata of a record has been created, the actual data of the record can be added in a separate view, which
  the application will redirect to automatically. This view is just one part of the record menu, the next section
  describes the purpose of the others.
</p>
<h5 id="manage-record">Managing existing records</h5>
<p>
  Aside from managing the files of a record there are also some other views, each of which can be accessed through the
  respective item in the navigation menu of a record. The menu items are briefly described below.
</p>
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Record</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    <p>
      This view gives an overview of the whole record, divided into different tabs, including all of its metadata and
      files, linked resources, access permissions and metadata revisions. On the main overview tab it is also possible
      to export, publish or copy a record. Publishing records is only available if at least one publication provider has
      been registered with the application.
    </p>
    Each file of a record also has another navigation menu similar to that of a record, accessed by clicking on the
    respective file. This menu provides the following two views:
    <dl class="row mt-2">
      <dt class="col-xl-3">File</dt>
      <dd class="col-xl-9">
        Shows an overview about the file and its metadata. Additionally, many file types also include a basic preview
        functionality.
      </dd>
      <dt class="col-xl-3">Edit file</dt>
      <dd class="col-xl-9">Allows editing the basic metadata of a file or deleting it.</dd>
      <dt class="col-xl-3">Update data</dt>
      <dd class="col-xl-9">
        Allows editing the actual data of a file. Some file types may offer direct editing of the data, otherwise the
        regular upload functionality can be used.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Add files</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    This view allows adding one or more files to a record, usually by uploading locally stored files. Certain types of
    files may also be created directly via the web interface.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Edit record</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    This view allows editing the metadata of a record, which is mostly identical to creating a record. The main
    difference is that it is also possible to delete the record.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Manage links</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    In this view, a record can be linked to other records or collections using the respective tab. Collections are
    simple, logical groupings of multiple records, while links between records can specify their relationship. The
    latter can also contain additional metadata, which currently includes the name/type of the link and a timestamp.
    Linking resources requires link permission in both resources that should be linked together. Note that users still
    won't be able to view any linked resources if they have no explicit permission to do so.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Manage permissions</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    This view allows explicitly setting access permissions for a record to individual users or groups of users.
    Currently, this works by using predefined roles. Details about the specific actions each role provides can be found
    using the <em>Role permissions</em> popover in this view. Note that group roles are always shown to users being able
    to manage permissions, even if the group would normally not be visible. This way, existing group roles can always be
    changed and/or removed. Such group roles only contain very limited information about the group itself.
  </dd>
