# Auto Flutter
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4mqob9dpr98a8dlm/branch/main?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DIG-/auto-flutter/branch/main)

Automatic build tools for flutter build tools

### Reason
Flutter build tools does not allow to create or bind tasks, making some process tedious.
Auto Flutter came with that in mind. Tasks that can be bind with other, and some integrations, like Firebase AppDist out of box.
