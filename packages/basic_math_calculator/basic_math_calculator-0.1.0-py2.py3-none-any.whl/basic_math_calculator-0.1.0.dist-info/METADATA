# Basic calculator


This is a calculator project for basic math functions.<br />
Implemented methods:<br />
				addition<br />
				subtraction<br />
				multiplication<br />
				division<br />
				nth-root ((n) root of a number)<br />
				reset memory<br />

# Installation


pip install basic-math-calculator

from calculator.calculator import Calculator


# Usage

Result is stored and overwritten in memory until reset() method is ran.

Calculation methods can take either one or two arguments (in addition to self).
If only one arguments is given calculations will be performed with memory value (latest result), otherwise calculations will be performed between two arguments and memory value will be overwritten.

For example:

	>>> calc = Calculator()
	>>> calc.addition(4, 5)
	9
	>>> calc.addition(10)
	19
	>>> calc.multiplication(2)
	38
	>>> calc.multiplication(2, 5)
	10
	>>> calc.reset()
	0
