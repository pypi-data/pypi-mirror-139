Description: # django-directed
        
        Tools for building, querying, manipulating, and exporting directed graphs with django
        
        ## Background
        
        This project is the successor of another django package of mine, [django-postgresql-dag](https://pypi.org/project/django-postgresql-dag/), which itself was forked and heavily modified from [django-dag](https://pypi.org/project/django-dag/) and [django-dag-postgresql](https://pypi.org/project/django-dag-postgresql/).
        
        When I started building django-postgresql-dag, I was rather new to a lot of concepts in both graph theory and database queries. As a result, I felt that I backed myself into corners in some ways with that earlier package. I developed django-postgresql-dag to serve as the underlying structure of an application that modeled real-world infrastructure as a directed acyclic graph, but I soon found that there were other graph-related things I wanted to be able to do that were not DAG-specific. Additionally, using CTE's in django has been somewhat democratized with the django-cte package and other changes over the years, and it might be feasible to port at least a portion of the graph functionality to database backends other than Postgres.
        
        Some of the design decisions here:
        - *A reasonable amount of flexibility* - The predecessor for this package was limited (in name and in some implementation aspects) solely to working with Directed Acyclic Graphs. But I find that I often need other types of directed graphs. This package should still do one thing well - working with directed graphs - but I've opened the scope a bit. There are a lot of commonalities between all types of directed graphs, so the package need not balloon to solve every graph situation or need. Directed graphs in general can solve or model an incredible number of real-world or web-related things.
        - *Prioritize querying over writing* - For my typical purposes, quickly adding large graphs to the database is an uncommon task. Instead, in most graph applications I am either slowly adding a node here and there (comments, categories, etc), or I am adding large graphs in an asynchronous manner (uploading and building the graph of an entire physical infrastructure model from a CSV file). In either case, the speed at which the graph is written is of much less consequence than the ability to query the resulting graph quickly.
        - *Include tools for modifying and reconfiguring graphs* - pre-processing (calculating graph hashes, etc), move or copy sections of a graph, insert and delete nodes, etc.
        - *Optimized for sparse graphs* - Most of the graph structures I find myself building are sparse. There are generally few connections from each node to another. Said another way, the typical degree of the nodes is small (often 1 to 5 or so). This seems pretty common for many real-world models such as physical infrastructure, as well as many common web & software related graph uses such as threaded comments, automation processes, and version control systems. If you are trying to model large, highly-connected graphs, this might not be the right package for you.
        
        ## Scope & Goals
        
        This package should be complete enough to perform a majority of tasks needed for working with an assortment of directed graphs in django applications, but it should also be flexible and extensible enough to allow for customization and novel approaches to problems in practical graph application.
        
        ### Building Directed Graphs
        
        The scope of this package includes working with a variety of directed graphs. This includes eventually supporting functionality for each of these types of directed graphs:
        
            Directed graphs aka DiGraphs
                Directed cyclic graph
                Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
                    Polytree (or directed tree, oriented tree, or singly connected network) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree
                        Arborescence (or out-tree or rooted tree) (single-rooted polytree)
                            Directed binary tree
                            Directed quadtree
                            Directed octree
        
        Other things to consider as a possibility:
        
            Multigraphs - the same pair of nodes may be connected by multiple edges. This might be further constrained in a cyclic graph to limit edges between two nodes to no more than two, with one edge in each direction.
        
        
        ### Querying Directed Graphs
        
        
        ### Manipulating Directed Graphs
        
        
        ### Exporting Directed Graphs
        
        
        ## Example use-cases
        
        Graphs can be used to model an incredibly large range of ideas, physical systems, concepts, web-components, etc. Here is a very incomplete list of some of the ways you might use django-directed, along with the underlying structure that might be best to represent them.

        Essentially, just about anything involving causal relationships, hierarchies, or dependencies can be modeled with a directed graph. This package may be useful if you need to persist that information for use with django applications.
        
        ## Why not use a graph database instead?
        
        - Compatibility - Graph databases don't play very nicely with Django and the Django ORM. There are 3rd party packages to shoehorn in the required functionality, but django is designed for relational databases.
        - Simplicity - If most of the work you are doing needs a relational database, mixing an additional database into the project might not be ideal.
        - Tradeoffs - Graph databases are not a panacea. They bring their own set of pros and cons. Maybe a graph database is ideal for your project. But maybe you'll do just as well using django-directed. I encourage you to read up on the benefits graph databases bring, the issues they solve, and also the areas where they do not perform as well as a relational database.
        
        ## ToDo
        
        - [ ] Write the code!
        - [ ] Write documentation for ReadTheDocs
        - [ ] Build example applications
