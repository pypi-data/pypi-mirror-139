    Checks that a user has mitosheet installed on JLab 2.0, and
    if so attempts to upgrade them to JLab 3.0 and mitosheet3.

    This is useful for migrating users from JLab 3.0 to JLab 2.0. 

    It does so by:
    1.  Checking we are in the correct state (e.g. 2.0, with mitosheet
        installed.)
    2.  Uninstalling the dependencies of mitosheet and the widget manager
        to not mess with the next step
    3.  Installing mitosheet as normal.

    NOTE: We expect the user to have a user.json if they are going to 
    run this command, as we expect they have used the tool.
