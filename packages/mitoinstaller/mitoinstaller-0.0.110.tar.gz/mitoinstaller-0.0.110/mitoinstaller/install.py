"""
We specify the installer as a list of steps that 
must run in order, for the installer.

Currently, we take the following steps:
1. First, try and install mitosheet3. Because mitosheet3 uses 
   JLab 3, we first check if the user has any conflicting
   JLab 2 dependencies installed. If they do, we abort. If they 
   don't, we update them to JLab 3.
2. Then, if the above installation of mitosheet3 fails for 
   any reason, we try to install mitosheet on JLab 2. 
3. If neither of them work, we give up, sadly.
