README
======

This package provides a long-running command to measure network performance.

Following figures are recorded to a csv file:

* packets sent
* packets received
* network latency
* statistics from the home router

Prerequisites
-------------

* ``Python >= 3.7``, due to usage of ``dataclasses`` and ``annotations``;
* Normally handled nicely py installation procedure: ``bs4``, ``click``,
  ``pyyaml``, ``psutil`` and ``requests`` third-party libraries.

Installation
------------

This package is hosted on `Pypi`, so it's as easy as:

    pip install connection-monitor

Usage
-----

1. Create a ``secrets.yml`` file with credentials to connect to your router;
   see content of sample file.

2. Open a terminal, activate the virtualenv if appropriate, and simply type::

    monitor

Available options:

* ``-s SECRETS_FILENAME``

  Filename to the secrets file.
  Defaults to ``secrets.yml`` in current working folder.

* ``-o FILENAME``

  Filename to write the stats into.
  By default, the stats go in current folder, in file named ``'network_data.csv'``.

  Writing is in append mode; previous data is kept.

* ``-h HOST [HOST...]``

  Address(es) to connect to, to measure latency.
  Defaults to some French web servers.

* ``-d DELAY``

  Delay between two samplings. Defaults to 1 minute, to behave fairly.

* ``-v``

  Verbosity setting; use it to show measurements to command line.
  Repeat it to show debug messages, i.e. ``-vv``.
  Default behavior is to show only errors and warnings.
