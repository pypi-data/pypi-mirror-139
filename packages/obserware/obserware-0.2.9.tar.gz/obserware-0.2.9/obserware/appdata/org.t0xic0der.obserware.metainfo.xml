  <summary>An advanced system monitor utility written in Python and Qt</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Obserware makes monitoring of advanced metrics accessible with the use of interactive graphs and charts. It is built on free and open-source technologies such as Python, Psutil, PyCPUinfo, Distro and Qt5. With the use of the utility, you can monitor
    </p>

      <li>Per-NIC activity, transfer rate in packet counts and bytes, total transmission, dropped transfers and more</li>
      <li>Per-unit metrics in both, occupancy percentage and active size of physical and logical partitions</li>
      <li>Static information about mount location, file system, unit name and much more of physical and logical partitions</li>
      <li>Dynamic listing of processes in process IDs, names, terminal, usernames, states, CPU and memory usage and thread counts</li>
      <li>Per-process information with process IDs, CPU and memory usage, CPU/thread counts, context switches and more</li>
