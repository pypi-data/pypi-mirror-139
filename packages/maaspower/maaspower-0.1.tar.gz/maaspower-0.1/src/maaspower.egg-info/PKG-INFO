        This project adds MAAS power control to servers that do not already have 
        a BMC type that MAAS supports. It uses a webhook to control switching 
        equipment that can power cycle such servers. 
        
        The project uses an extensible architecture so more switching device types 
        may be added, see `add_api`.
        
        At present it supports two flavours of switching control:
        
        - Command line interface. Anything that is controllable by a command line 
          utility that can be installed on the machine running this webhook service. 
        - SmartThings API: a popular Samsung IoT protocol that is supported by 
          thousands of devices
