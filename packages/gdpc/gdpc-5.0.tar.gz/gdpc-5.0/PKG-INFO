## GDPC 5.0 (Manicule)

GDPC (Generative Design Python Client) is a framework for use in conjunction with the [Minecraft HTTP Interface Mod](https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface) built for the [GDMC competition](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu).

You need to be playing in a Minecraft world with the mod installed to use the framework.

### Installation
**Keep in mind that tool and example scripts are not included in the package!** See 'Scripts' below for details.

To install the latest stable release, type one of the following commands:
- On Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m pip install gdpc`
- On Windows: `py -m pip install gdpc`

For the latest sexy-but-might-break-something release, type the following instead:
- On Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m pip install --pre gdpc`
- On Windows: `py -m pip install --pre gdpc`

To update your package, type the following:
- On Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade gdpc`
- On Windows: `py -m pip install --upgrade gdpc`

If you would like to install the latest stable version directly from GitHub, replace `gdpc` with

`git+https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_client_python`

For more information on installing from GitHub (such as getting old or dev versions) see the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/).
*(Hint: You can also use this command to import forks of this repository, just change the URL!)*

If you are having trouble with dependencies, download `requirements.txt` *(see below on how to download)* and try running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or `py -m pip pip install -r requirements.txt` if you are using Windows.

### Scripts:
To download one of the following scripts, click on the link, then right-click and `Save As...` *(I know it's tedious, if you have a better idea we'd be glad to hear it)*.

- [**`visualizeMap.py`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_client_python/master/visualizeMap.py): Displays a map of the Minecraft world using OpenCV
- [**`Start_Here.py`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_client_python/master/Start_Here.py): Demonstrates all of the basic GDPC functionality by building a simple model of the Emerald City and introduces various concepts of coding in Python
- **`Advanced example (coming soon!)`**
