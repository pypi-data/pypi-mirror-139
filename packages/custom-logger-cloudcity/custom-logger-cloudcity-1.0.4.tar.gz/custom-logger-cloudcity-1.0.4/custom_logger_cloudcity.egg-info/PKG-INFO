# Custom Logger CloudCity

To unify the way we log and alert to Google Cloud Logger and Sentry, we have created this package.

## Changelog
1.0.2 Removed the explicit requirement of havint the CLOUD_LOGGER_NAME environment var set. 
        When none is set, fall back on the default logger


## Example

How to use:

1. Include the package in your project by doing `pip install custom-logger-cloudcity`
2. Simply import the module!

Below is an examlpe how to use

```python
import os

os.environ.update({"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "{Location to you Service account key}"})
os.environ.update({"CLOUD_LOGGER_NAME": "nice_test_logger"})  # Give a name the app will log to
os.environ.update({"ENV": "development"})
# We need to set the environment vars before importing the custom_logger
# You can do so as this example or just set it in the machine wide environment
from custom_logger import custom_logger

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # A message as a string will end up in as a textPayload in Google Cloud Logging
    custom_logger.info("Hello My Friend")
    # Below will not be logged to Google Cloud Logging
    custom_logger.error("not ok")
    # A message as an argument will end up in as a jsonPayload in Google Cloud Logging
    custom_logger.info(some_message="This is a test log in a jsonPayload")
    # # An example with multiple arguments
    custom_logger.info(
        some_message="This is a test log in a jsonPayload",
        more_info="It has more info",
        and_even_more="These can all be metrics and stuff",
        but="We need to make sure that we catch the logging exceptions and print the whole lot",
    )
    # With message overwrite
    custom_logger.info(
        message="Let's overwrite the message node",
        some_message="This is a test log in a jsonPayload",
        more_info="It has more info",
        and_even_more="These can all be metrics and stuff",
        but="We need to make sure that we catch the logging exceptions and print the whole lot",
    )
    # You can even nest data, as this is stored as a struct in Google Cloud Logging
    custom_logger.info(message="This is message overwrite", amount_transfered=10, amount_failed=10,
                       errors=["a", "b", "c"])

```
