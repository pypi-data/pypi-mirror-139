title: >
  Compound bounding box for a model.

description: |
  This object contains a compound bounding box for a model, which defines
  a set of input-selectable bounding boxes. It consists of a list of selector_args
  together with a list of input-key bounding box pairs. The selector
  args are an ordered list of model inputs with an indication of whether
  or not to ignore the input in the bounding box selected. The key for
  each bounding box entry corresponds to the values of the selector args
  (in the order listed) which will select the accompanying bounding box.


examples:
  -
    - A compound bounding box with one selector_args and 1D bounding_box
