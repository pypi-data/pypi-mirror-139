        Global Chem is an open-source graph database and api for common and rare chemical lists using IUPAC as input and SMILES/SMARTS as output. As 
        mostly needed by myself as I search through chemical infinity.
        
        I have found these lists written in history to be useful, they come from a variety of different fields but are aggregated 
        into the most common format of organic chemists (IUPAC) and the common language of the cheminformatician (SMILES) and for 
        pattern matching (SMARTS).

        Installation 
        ============
        
        GlobalChem is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
        making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
        it yourself.
        
        ```
        
        pip install global-chem
        
        ```
        
        If you want to install the extensions package for extra functionality but with dependencies: https://github.com/Sulstice/global-chem-extensions
        
        ```
        
        pip install global-chem-extensions
        
        ```
        
        Rules
        =====
        
        The Graph Network (GN)s comes with a couple of rules that for now make the software engineering easier on the developer. 
        
        1.) There must be a root node.
        2.) When Adding a Node every node must be connected. 
        3.) To remove a node it must not have any children. 
        
        The Deep Graph Network (DGN)s comes also with a couple of rules to make the implementation easier:
        
        1.) There must be a root node of 1 which marks as your "input" node. 
        2.) When adding a layer all nodes will be added to all the previous layers as children. (Folk can use the remove node feature to perform dropouts)
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Just with no dependencies, intialize the class and there you go! All the common and rare groups of the world
        at your disposal 
        
        Adding Your Own Chemical List
        =============================
        
        If you would like to add your paper to the chemical graph network then please "File an Issue" with your chemical list 
        and perhaps a suggestion of where to add it or you can leave for up to us to decide. The format of the chemical list can
        be something like this:
        
        ```
        
        smiles = {
           '3,5-dimethoxyphenylisoproxycarbonyl': 'COC1=CC(C(C)(OC=O)C)=CC(OC)=C1',
           '2-(4-biphenyl)isopropoxycarbonyl': 'CC(C)(OC=O)C(C=C1)=CC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2',
           '2-nitrophenylsulfenyl': 'SC1=CC=CC=C1[N+]([O-])=O',
           'boc': 'O=COC(C)(C)C',
        }  
        
        ```

        GlobalChem, initially, is one class object with a series of Nodes that are act as objects for any common chemical lists. 
        The chemical lists can be accessed as nodes and the user can construct their own node trees for the lists.
        
        Also since these lists of commonality are stored on github it is easily searchable and tied directly to the paper for 
        any bypasser.

        =======
        
        GlobalChem was created because I noticed I was using the same variable across multiple scripts and figure it would be useful
        for folk to have.
