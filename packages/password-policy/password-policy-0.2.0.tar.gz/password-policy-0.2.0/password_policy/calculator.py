    Merge two CompositionRestrictions objects.
    
    It is unclear how to best do this. There are two approaches, with their associated limitations:
      (1) Keep track of both sets of restrictions seperately, calculating search space separately. The limitation with this method is that for nearly all real-world policies this would lead to significant overlap in the two search spaces (overestimating strength). The only way to compensate for this would be to enumerate the actual permutations, but this is not tractable.
      (2) Create a new restriction object that represents only the restrictions that are common between both, calculating the search space for this new restriction only. The limitation with this method is that it will count passwords that would fail both options. This will lead to an overstimate of the search space.
      
      Ultimately, we use (2) because it is faster and because we believe the overestimation to be much smaller. In fact, this will only be a problem for very complicated policies, none of which we have seen in practice. Also, for basic merges (2) will give the correct answers.
