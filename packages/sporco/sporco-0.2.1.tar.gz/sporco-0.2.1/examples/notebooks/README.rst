`Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ usage examples for the `SPORCO project <https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco>`__. These examples can be viewed online via `nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb>`__, or run interactively at `binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks/master?filepath=index.ipynb>`__. For viewing/running within a local environment rather than one of these cloud services, note that these examples are kept up to date with the current `development version of SPORCO <https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco>`__ rather than the most recent release; if installing *SPORCO* via ``pip``, it is recommended to do

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco

rather than

::

    pip install sporco
