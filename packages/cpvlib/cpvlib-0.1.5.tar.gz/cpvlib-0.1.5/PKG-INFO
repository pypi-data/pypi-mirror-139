`cpvlib` is an open source tool that provides a set of functions and classes 
for simulating the performance of concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems,
a specific type of photovoltiac systems composed of lenses and/or
mirrors that focus sunlight onto small cells. It makes special emphasys on
static micro CPV systems with internal tracking.
