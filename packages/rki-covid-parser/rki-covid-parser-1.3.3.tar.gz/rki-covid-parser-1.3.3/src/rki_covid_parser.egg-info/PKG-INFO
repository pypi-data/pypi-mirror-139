Python parser for the latest covid numbers from German RKI (Robert-Koch Institut).

## Installation
```pip install rki-covid-parser```

## Usage
Initialize the parser with an `aiohttp.session` and load the latest data.
```
parser = RkiCovidParser(session)        
await parser.load_data()


for district in parser.districts:
    # work with districts
    pass

for state in parser.states:
    # work with states
    pass

# work with the country
parser.country.cases
```

finished loading data, the parser contains a dictionary of districts, each with these properties:
