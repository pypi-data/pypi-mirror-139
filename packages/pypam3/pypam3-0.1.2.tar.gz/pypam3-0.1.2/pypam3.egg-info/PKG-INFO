# pypam3 - Project Assignment Method

  Pypam3 is a small tool to assign students(workers) to projects(jobs)
based on their rank of preference(cost) to each of the projects(jobs).

## module

Currently, there is only one module named *assign* in this package

### assign

Two functions, *assign_project()* and *generate_sample()*, realize
the facility.

#### assign_project(csv_name, capacity, **kwargs)

This function is for assigning. To use this function, you need to
put a .csv file on the same directory whose rows represent
students and columns represents projects. The numbers represent the rank of preference that students evaluate. No title should be included.
for example:

```text
5, 4, 2, 1, 3
4, 3, 2, 1, 5
3, 2, 1, 5, 4
```

To convert an Excel file to .csv file, you can easily use Microsoft Excel and press File-Save File as-.csv

The name of the csv file is the first argument.

The second argument is the number of students that a project can take at most.

This function also take several optional key-word arguments:

+ output: This argument has two options, *"file"* or *"stdout"*. The "file" value will ask the program to

output the result by creating a new file *result.xlsx*, the Sheet1 of the Excel file show the project that each student is assigned to, and the Sheet2 shows which students are assigned to each project.
The "stdout" option is the default option. It will directly output the result to the terminal.

+ deviation: If set to True(default), the program will also output the standard deviation to the terminal. If set to False, it will not be calculated.

+ time: If set to True(default), the program will also print the runtime of the function to the terminal. Otherwise, no.

Example of using:

```python
from pypam3.assign import assign_project
assign_project("data.csv", 5, output="file")
```

### generate_sample(csv_name, student_num, project_num)

This function can randomly generate samples, and it's mainly for testing purpose.

Example of using:

```python
from pypam3.assign import generate_sample
generate_sample("data.csv", 80, 20)
```

This will create a csv file named "data.csv" at the current directory with 80 rows and 20 columns.

## Using

First install python3 from <https://www.python.org>. Note that the package should be added to PATH.
To download this package, type in the terminal:
linux/mac:

```shell
pip3 install pypam3
pip3 install openpyxl
pip3 install munkres
```

windows:

```shell
pip install pypam3
pip install openpyxl
pip install munkres
```

And add these lines at the beginning of your python script:

```python
from pypam3.assign import generate_sample, assign_project
from munkres import Munkres
import openpyxl
```

Then you can use this package as stated above.
