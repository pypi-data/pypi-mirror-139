# Ammonite: Geometry calculation cheatsheet

Unit aware calculation of geometrical primitives' area, volumes, etc. It is base
on [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for a seamless unit management and
easy conversion.

This package is at an early stage of development, it currently only include

- 3D:
    - Box
    - Cube
    - Sphere

- 2D:
    - Rectangle
    - Square
    - Circle

## Usage

```python
from ammonite import ureg
from ammonite.Object3D import Sphere

my_sphere = Sphere(radius=3 * ureg.meter)
print(my_sphere.volume)
# 113.09733552923254 meter ** 3
print(my_sphere.area)
# 113.09733552923255 meter ** 2
```

Any comments to report a bug, improve this package, make it follow best practices which
I might not know of or improve its automation are welcome.
