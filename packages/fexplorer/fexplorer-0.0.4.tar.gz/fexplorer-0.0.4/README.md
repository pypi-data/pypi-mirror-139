## Installation
```python
pip install fexplorer
```
## Usage
```python
fexplorer path mode(optional, default="n")
```
When mode is n (default),
- It reads the file contents (if the file is readible).
- You have options to open vi or you can go back.

When mode is e,
- The custom script you write will be run.
- Edit [customscript.py](https://github.com/aysilsimgekaracan/fexplorer/blob/main/fexplorer/customscript.py) file.

To start with your current directory, you can simply run:
```python
fexplorer .
```

If you want to run your script,
```python
fexplorer . --m e
```

## Instructions
