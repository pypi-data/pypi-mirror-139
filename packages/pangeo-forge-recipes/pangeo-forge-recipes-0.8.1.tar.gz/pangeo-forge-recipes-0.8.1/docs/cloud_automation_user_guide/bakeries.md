# Bakeries

As described in {doc}`../recipe_user_guide/execution`, you can define and execute recipes on your
own computers using the executor of your choice.
However, you can also contribute your recipe to the Pangeo Forge {doc}`recipe_box`.
and have it executed automatically in the cloud.
Cloud based execution is provided by Bakeries.

There are currently two types of Bakeries implemented:

- <https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-aws-bakery> -
  Bakery for Amazon Web Services cloud
- <https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-azure-bakery> -
  Bakery for Microsoft Azure cloud

If you are interested in deploying your own bakery, please consult those repos
for more information.
