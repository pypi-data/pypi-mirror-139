DaNLP is a repository for Natural Language Processing resources for the Danish Language. 
It is a collection  of available datasets and models for a variety of NLP tasks. 
The aim is to make it easier and more applicable to practitioners in the industry to use 
Danish NLP and hence this project is licensed to allow commercial use. 
The project features code examples on how to use the datasets and models in popular 
NLP frameworks such as spaCy, Transformers and Flair as well as Deep Learning frameworks 
such as PyTorch. 
See our [documentation pages](https://danlp-alexandra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
for more details about our models and datasets, and definitions of the modules provided 
through the DaNLP package. 

If you are new to NLP or want to know more about the project in a broader perspective, you can start on our [microsite](https://danlp.alexandra.dk/).


<br/>**Help us improve DaNLP**

- :raising_hand: Have you tried the DaNLP package? Then we would love to chat with you about your experiences from a company perspective. It will take approx 20-30 minutes and there's no preparation. English/danish as you prefer. Please leave your details [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=zSPaS4dKm0GkfXZzEwsohKhC_ON5BmxBtRwkonVf21tUQUxDQ0oyTVAyU0tDUDVDMTM4SkU4SjJISi4u) and then we will reach out to arrange a call. 

**News**

- :tada: Version 0.1.2 has been [released](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/releases) with 
  - 2 new models for hate speech detection ([Hatespeech](https://danlp-alexandra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tasks/hatespeech.html)) based on BERT and ELECTRA
  - 1 new model for hate speech classification 


**Next up**

- new model and data for discourse coherence 


## Installation

To get started using DaNLP in your python project simply install the pip package. Note that installing the default pip package 
will not install all NLP libraries because we want you to have the freedom to limit the dependency on what you use. Instead we provide you with an installation option if you want to install all the required dependencies. 

### Install with pip

To get started using DaNLP simply install the project with pip:

```bash
pip install danlp 
```

Note that the default installation of DaNLP does not install other NLP libraries such as Gensim, SpaCy, flair or Transformers.
This allows the installation to be as minimal as possible and let the user choose to e.g. load word embeddings with either spaCy, flair or Gensim.  Therefore, depending on the function you need to use, you should install one or several of the following: `pip install flair`, `pip install spacy ` or/and `pip install gensim `. 

Alternatively if you want to install all the required dependencies including the packages mentionned above, you can do:

```bash
pip install danlp[all]
```

You can check the `requirements.txt` file to see what version the packages has been tested with.

### Install from source

If you want to be able to use the latest developments before they are released in a new pip package, or you want to modify the code yourself, then clone this repo and install from source.

```
git clone https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp.git
cd danlp
# minimum installation
pip install .
# or install all the packages
pip install .[all]
```

To install the dependencies used in the package with the tested versions:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Install from github
Alternatively you can install the latest version from github using:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp.git
```

### Install with Docker 
To quickly get started with DaNLP and to try out the models you can use our Docker image.
To start a ipython session simply run:
```bash
docker run -it --rm alexandrainst/danlp ipython
```
If you want to run a `<script.py>` in your current working directory you can run:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app alexandrainst/danlp python <script.py>

```

### Quick Start

## NLP Models

Natural Language Processing is an active area of research and it consists of many different tasks. 
The DaNLP repository provides an overview of Danish models for some of the most common NLP tasks (and is continuously evolving). 

Here is the list of [NLP tasks](https://danlp-alexandra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tasks.html) we currently cover in the repository.
-  [Embedding of text](docs/docs/tasks/embeddings.md)
-  [Part of speech tagging](docs/docs/tasks/pos.md)
-  [Dependency parsing](docs/docs/tasks/dependency.md)
-  [Named entity recognition](docs/docs/tasks/ner.md)
-  [Named entity disambiguation](docs/docs/tasks/ned.md)
-  [Coreference resolution](docs/docs/tasks/coreference.md)
-  [Sentiment analysis](docs/docs/tasks/sentiment_analysis.md)
-  [Hatespeech detection](docs/docs/tasks/hatespeech.md)

You can also find some of our [transformers](docs/docs/frameworks/transformers.md) models on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/DaNLP). 

If you are interested in Danish support for any specific NLP task you are welcome to get in contact with us.

We also recommend to check out the [list](https://github.com/fnielsen/awesome-danish) of Danish NLP corpora/tools/models maintained by Finn Årup Nielsen (Warning: not all items are available for commercial use, check the licence).

## Datasets
The number of datasets in the Danish language is limited. The DaNLP repository provides an overview of the available [Danish datasets](https://danlp-alexandra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/datasets.html) that can be used for commercial purposes.

The DaNLP package allows you to download and preprocess datasets.

## Examples
You will find examples that shows how to use NLP in Danish (using our models or others) in our [benchmark](/examples/benchmarks) scripts and jupyter notebook [tutorials](/examples/tutorials). 

This project keeps a Danish written [blog](https://medium.com/danlp) on medium where we write about Danish NLP, and in time we will also provide some real cases of how NLP is applied in Danish companies.
