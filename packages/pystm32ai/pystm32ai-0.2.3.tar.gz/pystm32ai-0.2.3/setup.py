    'long_description': '# PySTM32.AI\n\nA python wrapper for the `stm32ai` command-line tool to analyse deep learning models for STM32 microcontrollers.\n\nDisclaimer: This project is not related to STMicroelecronics, it is as a wrapper around a component of [X-CUBE-AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html) property of STMicroelecronics and licensed under SLA0048 (see more below).\n\n## How it works\n\nThe API provide two functions : `analyse` and `generate`, the first one gives information about the size of a model and the second one can be used to generate C files to link with X-CUBE-AI runtime library (Not provided in this package).\n\nThe package doesn\'t include stm32ai executable so it will download and install it automatically on first call.\n\nA command line utility is also provided (`pystm32ai`), however it currently doesn\'t match the full functionality provided by the original `stm32ai` executable.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith pip:\n\n```bash\npip3 install pystm32ai\n```\n\nFrom wheel:\n\nDownload wheel from Releases and install with pip:\n\n```bash\npip3 install pystm32ai-*.whl\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Python API\n\nThe goal of this tool is to use stm32ai in a deep learning training pipeline, where it can give information about the final model running on STM32\n\n```python\nfrom pystm32ai import stm32ai\n\nreport = stm32ai.analyse(\'path/to/model.tflite\')\nprint(report)\n\nstm32ai.generate(\'path/to/model.tflite\') # C files are generated in the current directory\n```\n\n### Command line tool\n\nThe project can also be used as a command line tool:\n\n```sh\npystm32ai analyse path/to/model.tflite\npystm32ai generate path/to/model.tflite\n```\n\nHere is the full usage :\n\n```text\nusage: pystm32ai [-h] [--allocate-inputs] [--allocate-outputs] [--full-report] [--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--name NAME] {analyse,generate} model_path\n\nPython wrapper around stm32ai command line tool\n\npositional arguments:\n  {analyse,generate}    Action to run on stm32ai\n  model_path            Path to model\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --allocate-inputs\n  --allocate-outputs\n  --full-report\n  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR\n  --name NAME           Name of the model\n```\n\n### Full API specification\n\n```python\ndef analyse(\n    model_path, allocate_inputs=True, allocate_outputs=False, full_report=False\n):\n    """\n    Analyse a model with CubeAI to get info about RAM, ROM and MACC\n    Params:\n        model_path: path to a model (ONNX, h5 or TFLITE)\n        allocate_inputs: whether to allocate input tensor with activations\n        allocate_outputs: whether to allocate output tensor with activations\n        full_report: Get a full report with per-layers information\n    Returns:\n        A report as a dictionary\n    """\n\ndef generate(\n    model_path, allocate_inputs=True, allocate_outputs=False, name=None, output_dir="."\n):\n    """\n    Generate a model C files to use in a STM32 application\n    Params:\n        model_path: path to a model (ONNX, h5 or TFLITE)\n        allocate_inputs: whether to allocate input tensor with activations\n        allocate_outputs: whether to allocate output tensor with activations\n        output_dir: Path to output directory (default current working directory)\n    """\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe pystm32ai project is under the [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)\n\nIt\'s using part of the X-CUBE-AI software which is under SLA0048 license, hence, by using this software you agree to the terms and condition of the SLA048 license.
