    """Create a Dask cluster with Coiled

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_workers
        Number of workers in this cluster. Defaults to 4.
    name
        Name to use for identifying this cluster. Defaults to ``None``.
    software
        Name of the software environment to use.
    worker_class
        Worker class to use. Defaults to "dask.distributed.Nanny".
    worker_options
        Mapping with keyword arguments to pass to ``worker_class``. Defaults to ``{}``.
    worker_vm_types
        List of instance types that you would like workers to use, this list can have up to five items.
        You can use the command ``coiled.list_instance_types()`` to se a list of allowed types.
    scheduler_class
        Scheduler class to use. Defaults to "dask.distributed.Scheduler".
    scheduler_options
        Mapping with keyword arguments to pass to ``scheduler_class``. Defaults to ``{}``.
    scheduler_vm_types
        List of instance types that you would like the scheduler to use, this list can have up to
        five items.
        You can use the command ``coiled.list_instance_types()`` to se a list of allowed types.
    asynchronous
        Set to True if using this Cloud within ``async``/``await`` functions or
        within Tornado ``gen.coroutines``. Otherwise this should remain
        ``False`` for normal use. Default is ``False``.
    cloud
        Cloud object to use for interacting with Coiled.
    account
        Name of Coiled account to use. If not provided, will
        default to the user account for the ``cloud`` object being used.
    shutdown_on_close
        Whether or not to shut down the cluster when it finishes.
        Defaults to True, unless name points to an existing cluster.
    use_scheduler_public_ip
        Boolean value that determines if the Python client connects to the Dask scheduler using the scheduler machine's
        public IP address. The default behaviour when set to True is to connect to the scheduler using its public IP
        address, which means traffic will be routed over the public internet. When set to False, traffic will be
        routed over the local network the scheduler lives in, so make sure the scheduler private IP address is
        routable from where this function call is made when setting this to False.
    credentials
        Which credentials to use for Dask operations and forward to Dask clusters --
        options are "account", "local", or "none". The default behavior is to prefer
        credentials associated with the Coiled Account, if available, then try to
        use local credentials, if available.
        NOTE: credential handling currently only works with AWS credentials.
    timeout
        Timeout in seconds to wait for a cluster to start, will use ``default_cluster_timeout``
        set on parent Cloud by default.
    environ
        Dictionary of environment variables.
    show_state_updates
        Whether to show all state updates related to the cluster during launch.
