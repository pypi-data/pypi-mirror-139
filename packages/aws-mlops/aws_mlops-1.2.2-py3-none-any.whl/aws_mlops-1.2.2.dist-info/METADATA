Getting started
===============

AWS MLOps package is implemented to help you like a framework for deploying what it is necessary to manage your models.

The goal is to implement this package to keep your focus on your prep and test code using the AWS SageMaker services, AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda.

if you want to use the guide below, you have to install `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>`_ (`Node Package Manager <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands>`_) before.

If you want to use another AWS tool, you can see the repository `aws-tool-comparison <https://github.com/bilardi/aws-tool-comparison>`_ before to implement your version.
