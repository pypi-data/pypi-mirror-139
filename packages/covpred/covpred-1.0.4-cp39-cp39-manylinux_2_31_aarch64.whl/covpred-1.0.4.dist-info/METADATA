# EpidemicsRunner API #

**CovPred** is a Python library that provides various algorithms
useful for modeling population dynamics inferred from e.g. infectious diseases. Amongst others, it is used by [CovPred](www.CovPred.de) in this exact form.

# Description
The following algorithms are currently implemented:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|SIR|Classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered ODE Model augmented with a deceased class|
|SEIRD| Extended SIR model accounting for a new class (Exposed) amongst other additions|
|SEIRD_VARA|Extended SIR model paired with variable (over time) infection rate|
|SEIRD_CK|Coupled ODE SEIRD Model to model interaction between the ODE systems|
|SEIRD_PDE| A PDE formulation of the SEIRD model, discretized using Finite Differences|
