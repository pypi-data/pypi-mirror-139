INT. DOCUMENTATION - NIGHT

Illuminated by the computer's glow, AUDIENCE sits reading the documentation
for a Python library they haven't seen before. AUDIENCE is visibly startled
as a dulcet voice begins to speak.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
            ScreenPy is a library that provides the base for an
            automated test suite using Screenplay Pattern.

                              AUDIENCE
            Wha- who are you? Where are you? And... what is
            Screenplay Pattern?!

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
            It's a composition-based architecture pattern,
            encouraging automated test writers to write more
            maintainable test suites. It allows test writers to
            use Gherkin-style language in Python to create
            descriptive UI tests.

                              AUDIENCE
                              (reluctantly)
            Ignoring how you avoided answering my first questions,
            how do I get started?

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
            I thought you'd never ask...

                                                                      FADE OUT
