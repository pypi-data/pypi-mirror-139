## SongNameSplit

The SongNameSplit library can attempt to take a song title and identify the song name and artist name. The input is a string and the output would be a dictionary.



### Sample Input and Output

Input:

```

"Coldplay - Hymn For The Weekend (Official Video)"

```

Output:

```

{'artist': 'Coldplay', 'songname': 'Hymn For The Weekend'}

```

### Installation

SongNameSplit can be installed using the following pip code. Please note that the SongNameSplit library is internet-dependent, so a stable internet connection is essential.



```

pip install SongNameSplit

```

### Import

SongNameSplit can be imported using the following code:



```

import SongNameSplit

```

### Usage

SongNameSplit can be used as:

```

SongNameSplit.namesplit("<< SONG TITLE >>")

```

Replace the "<< SONG TITLE >>" with your song title.



### Sample Code





```

import SongNameSplit



result = SongNameSplit.namesplit("Coldplay - Hymn For The Weekend (Official Video)")



print("The name of the song is: ", result['songname'])

print("The name of the sartist is: ", result['artist'])

```
