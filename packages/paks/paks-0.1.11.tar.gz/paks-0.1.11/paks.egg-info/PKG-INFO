        With paks you can save the state of your current container, and issue other 
        commands to it while developing. For example:
        
        ```
        # Load my environment "github" that I share between development containers
        > #envload github
        
        # Save a new or updated variable to it on the fly!
        > #envsave github GITHUB_USER=abetterdinosaur
        
        # Save my running container "ubuntu" to the default "ubuntu-saved" preserving filesystem changes
        > #save
        
        # Oops I forgot something about the container. Inspect the config
        > #inspect config
        
        # Copy from host to container and back again
        > #cp host:PANCAKES.txt CONTAINER-PANCAKES.txt
        > #cp CONTAINER-PANCAKES.txt host:FINISHED-PANCAKES.txt
        
        # Get virtual size of running container
        > #size
        ```
        
        All of the above is possible without leaving your container! 🎉️ And more custom commands to
        load are under development! The sibling of this library is [syspack/pack](https://github.com/syspack/pack)
        which is implemented in Go.
        
        ## TODO
        
        - some commands to interact with a registry?
        - allow user to define custom commands on fly for container?
        - add singularity backend?
        - can we create some packaged thing with container, sbom?
        - can we add custom config file from remote? pakages? `#load <commandset>`
