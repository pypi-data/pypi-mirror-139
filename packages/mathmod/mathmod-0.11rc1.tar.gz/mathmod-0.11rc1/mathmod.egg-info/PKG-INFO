Description: # Mathmod
        Have you ever looked for a complete, simple calculator module? Well here you go!
        
        Mathmod is a high-level math module with logarithm, fibonacci, arithmetic, tax, interest, and other calculators! It's the core of Palc. (Palc is a text-calculator that strives to be simple while having many features.)
        
        Try it now - there are no fees, no risks, nothing! If you don't believe me, you can install from the source code manually. The code is available at https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-text-calculator/tree/master/mathmod.
        
        Anyway, have a great day! Bye :D
