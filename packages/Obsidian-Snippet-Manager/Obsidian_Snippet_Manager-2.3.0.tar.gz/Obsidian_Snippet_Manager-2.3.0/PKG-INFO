Obsidian Snippet Manager is a python script that git pull and move CSS file in your `.obsidian/snippet` folder.

# Get started
## Requirements
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. `pip install Obsidian-Snippet-Manager --upgrade`

# GUI
![](screenshot/demo2.gif)

You can use the application with an interface, using (in terminal): `snipetter`.

Information about [executable release](https://github.com/Mara-Li/Obsidian-Snippet-Manager/releases):
- It will don't install the CLI command, so you won't have the [Obsidian-Shell auto-update](README.md#in-obsidian).
- The executable don't use the same environment file as the package : You need to configure two times if you use the two (CLI + executable released)
- Delete the release delete the environment file. Beware when you update your executable.

You can select the files you want to update or clone. Also, you can only use some specific file from update, instead of entire folder.
You can exclude them from futur update using the exclude button.

# CLI
## Environment
The plugin needs :
- The **absolute** path of your vault, as : `G:\Drive\Vault`
- A folder that contains **all** the snippet you want to get the update.
This folder can be everywhere on your computer (yes, it can be in `.obsidian` too.). It will contain all folder of the snippet hosted on GitHub you want to use.  
    _In case of the folder doesn't exist, the script will create it!_

## How to use

1. Adding a new repo : `obsnipe clone repository_url`  
    Additionally, you can exclude a folder from update with adding the `--exclude` command : `obsnipe clone [repository_url] --excluded`  
    This command work also for file : `obsnipe clone [repository_url] --excluded file.css`. This file will be added to `exclude.yml`. 
2. Updating everything : `obsnipe`
3. Updating only a repository : `obsnipe update folder_name` 
    The folder name is the folder that you wish to update the snippet!  
    Also, you can update only a specific file with `obsnipe update [foldername] --only [filename]`

The script will :
- Git pull 
- Git move every `.css` (unless the excluded) file in your `.obsidian/snippet` folder.

## Other function
- `obsnipe list` : List all GitHub Repository you download.
- `obsnipe exclude [folder_name]` : Exclude a folder or a css snippet from update. You can exclude multiple value using : `obsnipe exclude [folder1] [filename2]`  
    Using `-add [filename][folder]` will add these file in `exclude.yml`

Note : You can exclude a folder from auto-update using the `exclude.yml` file, placed in your Snippet Manager folder. 
You need to add the folder name as a yaml list :
```yml
- foldername1
- foldername2
```
