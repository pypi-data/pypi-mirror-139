# This is a template for a config file specifying octofludb database
# configuration and data sources.

# This is the name of the GraphDB repository. You normally should not have to
# change this since the `octofludb init` command will create a repo with the
# expected name ("octofludb"). The only reason why you might need to change
# this is if you want to build multiple repositories (for example, one that
# contains private data for internal use and one that is publicly exposed
# through a SPARQL endpoint). `octofludb init` may be bypassed by explictly
# creating a GraphDB repo with `pgraphdb make`.
repo: 'octofludb'

# The url where GraphDB is hosted.
host: 'http://localhost:7200'

# An absolute path to location of the top folder that stores octofludb data
datadir: '~/octofludb-data'

# The path relative to `home` to epiflu (gisaid) fasta files

# The path relative to `home` to epiflu (gisaid) metadata files
epiflu_meta: 'epiflu/*/*.xls'

# The relative paths to files containing tags. Each tag (for example,
# 'cdc_cvv') is associated with one or more files of ids. Each file should
# contain no header and a single column of identifies. Identifiers may be any
# term that octofludb can consistently recognize, including strain names,
# genbank ids, USDA surveillance barcodes, epiflu ids, and epiflu isolate ids.
