# Biodivine Aeon (Python)

Here, we have Python bindings for the main functionality of the tool Aeon. At the moment, this is symbolic attractor detection and classification (as stable, oscillating and disordered attractors), but eventually, it may also include model checking and control synthesis. 

The library is available on `PyPi`, so you can install it directly through pip:

```
pip install biodivine_aeon
```

A basic example of usage for the Python byndings is provided in this [Jupyter notebook](https://deepnote.com/project/Aeonpy-Examples-CR33GbmyS2e4tqqZCcCwjA/%2Fexample_aeon.ipynb). To learn more details about the library, you can also inspect Aeon [manual](https://biodivine.fi.muni.cz/aeon/manual/v0.4.0/index.html). But the manual is mainly focused on the GUI of the tool.
