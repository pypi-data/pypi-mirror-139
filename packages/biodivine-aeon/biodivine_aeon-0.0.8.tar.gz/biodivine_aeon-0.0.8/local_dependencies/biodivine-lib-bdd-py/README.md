# Biodivine BDD library (Python)

This repository contains simple Python bindings for the [Biodivine BDD library](https://github.com/sybila/biodivine-lib-bdd). It allows you to quickly create and manage binary decision diagrams from Python.

To install the bindings, run

```
pip install biodivine_bdd
```

Other examples on how to use the Python bindings are available in this [jupyter notebook](https://deepnote.com/project/Aeonpy-Examples-CR33GbmyS2e4tqqZCcCwjA/%2Fexample_bdd.ipynb). Additional documentation is currently available only in the source code (or in the original Rust library), however the tutorial should hopefully cover most topics well. In case of any problems, do not hesitate to create an issue and get in touch.
