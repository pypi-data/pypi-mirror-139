# py-reddit

A package that can be used to get reddit submissions, and their various attributes.
The package supports both synchronous and asynchronous development.
I am more familiar with synchronous programming, but have tried my best at making a good asynchronous implementation.
The package is written in Python 3.10, and uses requests and aiohttp as its main dependencies.

Updates will be coming soon, thank you for viewing this package, please consider using it.

Version - 1.0.2

Installation methods:

```
pip3 install py-reddit

Asynchronus client:

```py
import reddit
import asyncio

client = reddit.AsyncClient()
