qplot
=============


`qplot` is matplotlib based Python library to visualize `SciGRID_gas data  <https://www.gas.scigrid.de/downloads.html>`_ 

It is independent of the `SciGRID_gas main library <https://www.gas.scigrid.de/downloads.html>`_ or 
the `osmscigrid library  <https://www.gas.scigrid.de/downloads.html>`_.


Features
--------

What it provides:

- Automatic and customisable visualisation of SciGRID_gas data
- Visualisation of a backgroundmap for Europe or one of its states
- Piperoutes can be colormapped to parameters
- The thickness of Piperoute can be mapped to parameters 
- Components other than Piperoutes can be made clickable to provide meta information (beta)
- A mechanism to read SciGRID_gas data from CSV files into a SciGRID_gas network class.



Installation
------------

``qplot`` depends on a Python version of 3.6 or above as well as the
following libraries:

-   "matplotlib==3.3.3",
-   "mplcursors>=0.3",
-   "PyShp",
-   "numpy==1.19.4",
-   "pathlib>=1.0.1",
-   "descartes==1.1.0",
-   "adjustText==0.7.3",
-   "Unidecode==1.1.1",
-   "Shapely==1.7.1"

Use ``pip`` to install ``qplot``:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install qplot

From there you can import the quickplot function via:

.. code:: bash

    $from qplot.qplot import quickplot

Download of WorldBorders
------------------------

In the next step you need to navigate to

https://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php

and download the TM_WORLD_BORDERS-zipfile.

You can pass the variable 'TM_Borders_filename'
to the quickplot function.

The presetting is: 
```

```python
TM_Borders_filename='../TM_World_Borders/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp'
```

``` eval_rst
Please remember to use '\' as folder separator if you are a Windows user ;)
