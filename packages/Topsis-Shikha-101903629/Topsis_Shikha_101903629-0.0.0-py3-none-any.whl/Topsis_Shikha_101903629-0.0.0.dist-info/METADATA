Submitted By: Shikha 101903629

-------------

### What is TOPSIS?
A simple but powerful decision method.


![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0_imbSU7mH4/hqdefault.jpg)

TOPSIS, known as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, is a multi-criteria decision analysis method. It compares a set of alternatives based on a pre-specified criterion. The method is used in the business across various industries, every time we need to make an analytical decision based on collected data.
### How to use this package?
To begin with, you have to install the package 'Topsis_Shikha_101903629' using the following command:
bash
pip install Topsis_Shikha_101903629

Then you just need to do a function call by passing some specified parameters.
We provided you with a function named as top_score().
This function requires three parameters.
### Parameters:

1. First Parameter - Matrix

   Create a matrix consisting of M alternatives and N criteria. This matrix is usually called an “evaluation matrix”.
All values should be numerical.

2. Second Parameter - Array consisting weights for each column. 

   Assign weights to each column. Weights
can be (1,1,1,1) or (1,1,0.5,0.5) or (1,1,2,2)

3. Third Parameter - Array consisting impact of each column. 

   E.g. : (1,0,1,1) (1 for max value as best, 0 for min value as best)


Example:
bash
from python_topsis import Topsis_Shikha_101903629 as tps
tps.top_score(evaluation_matrix, weights, impacts)
