"""
Produce an optimal partition by solving an integer linear program (ILP).

The top-level solver is CVXPY, but it must have some concrete ILP solvers installed. The options are:

* XPRESS, CPLEX, GUROBI, MOSEK - work well, but they are not free.
* ECOS_BB - gives wrong results even on simple problems - not recommended.
* GLPK_MI (comes with CVXOPT) - very slow.
* SCIP - Requires lengthy installation. See here https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt for details.
* CBC - Requires installation: pip install cylp. See here https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP for details.

    copies
        how many copies are there from each number.
