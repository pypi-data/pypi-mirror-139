Find all available symbols on the \n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/markets) platform.\n\nOnce the `Kedro` pipeline is launched, everything works smoothly and automatically. \n\nThere is 5 steps for the pipeline to complete:\n- \U0001fa99 Fetching data from Binance API.\n- 🔨 Preprocessing data:\n    - Extract features from fetched data.\n    - Split extracted features.\n    - Scale splitted features.\n    - Create sequences with scaled train features.\n    - Create sequences with scaled test features.\n    - Split train sequences as train and validation sequences.\n- 🏋️ Training model.\n- 🔄 Converting model to ONNX format.\n- 📁 Uploading converted model to object storage service.\n\nAfter the end of the training pipeline, the new model will be available for serving. \nEvery 10 minutes, a `Prefect` flow is launched to update the API with lastest available models for each currency.\n\nThe final step is the crypto dashboard that allows users to see forecasting for their favorite assets.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe main project has `poetry` as package manager. If you need to install poetry, check their awesome \n[documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).\n\nYou don\'t need to clone this project to your local machine. You can simply install the `make-us-rich` package with this \ncommand:\n```bash\n$ pip install make-us-rich\n```\n\nIt\'s recommended to have an isolated environment for each component of the project, unless you run everything on the \nsame machine.\n\n\n## CLI Usage\n\nTODO\n',
